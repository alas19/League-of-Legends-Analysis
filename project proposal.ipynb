    "   I am a *Lol player* since I graduated from highschool. Back then, I did not know all this kind of stuffs. Now, I will use a dataset about League of Legends from 9th season and all the game played in Europe server. Actually, I was looking for a Covid-19 dataset on [Github](https://github.com/topics/dataset). After that, I found this [Github repository](https://github.com/leomaurodesenv/game-datasets) by chance and I decided to look at it. Then, I went [through](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/league-of-legends?select=games.csv) [these](https://www.kaggle.com/code/youngprize33/py-pandas-tutorial) [pages](https://www.datamanim.com/dataset/99_pandas/pandasMain.html) (each of them has different links). Finally, Here is [my dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Datamanim/pandas/main/lol.csv)."

Some of the things we see in the columns of the dataset are effective in winning this game like rift herald, baron, dragon kills.\n",

I will also investigate how long an average game lasts, if it has an effect, how much the factors I have mentioned affect it.

    "+ Then, I will do some data acquisition to reach every purpose of the project. I said that the character selected in the game affects the result. I will analyze it on a character basis. I will also calculate a win rate on the basis of banned characters. I will investigate if the objectives on the lol map lead the teams to win.\n",
    "+ With this project, I will actually make more inferences on the basis of characters. Later on, I will explain the results that I can apply to my own game."
